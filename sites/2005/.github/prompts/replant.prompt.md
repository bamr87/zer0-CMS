description: "End this repository's growth generation and plant its successor: finalize and compact the current knowledge base, mark it mature, then spawn a fresh repo for the next concept in the lineage carrying only the necessary context and files. Use when: check-lifecycle reports phase `replant` (generation tick budget spent); manually rotating the lineage to its next subject. Concept-agnostic — succession rule and lineage come from lifecycle.yml."
argument-hint: "Optional: `--force` to replant before the tick budget is spent, or an explicit successor subject to override the succession rule."

Run the **replant routine**: close out this repository's growth generation and spawn its successor.
A replant is two halves of one operation — (a) compact this repo to a finished, seed-rebuildable
state, and (b) plant the framework into a **new repository** for the next concept, carrying only
the necessary context and files.

Read [lifecycle.yml](../../lifecycle.yml) and the Concept Definition in [seed.md](../../seed.md)
first — everything is parameterized by them.

## Preconditions

1. Run the **check-lifecycle** skill. Proceed only if it reports phase `replant`
   (`generation_ticks ≥ replant_after_ticks`), or the user passed `--force`.
2. Confirm push access and the ability to create repositories. In CI the ambient GitHub token is
   scoped to this repo only and **cannot** create repos — the PAT arrives as the `LIFECYCLE_PAT`
   environment variable; verify it is non-empty and run repo-creation/archival commands as
   `GH_TOKEN="$LIFECYCLE_PAT" gh …`. (Interactively: any `gh` credential with repo-creation scope,
   or the GitHub MCP `create_repository` tool.) If no such credential exists, stop and report —
   never half-replant.

## Part A — Finalize this repo (compact in place)

1. **Settle structure** — run the **build-structure** skill so all generated artifacts (indices,
   TIMELINE, INDEX, cross-refs) reflect final content.
2. **Compact the roadmap** — collapse unfinished Now/Backlog items into **Ideas** with a note
   `deferred at replant`; Done stays as the generation's record.
3. **Sync the DNA** — run the **sync-seed** skill; verify seed.md §7 Rebuild Procedure plus §1–6
   genuinely suffice to reconstruct the repo (the necessary context IS the seed).
4. **Mark maturity** — in `lifecycle.yml`: set `state.status: mature` and this repo's lineage entry
   `status: mature`. Add a short *Status* line at the top of `README.md` noting the repo is mature
   and naming its successor (fill the link in after Part B).
5. **Record** — run the **encode-seed** prompt to append a `### Replant — <date>` entry to seed.md
   §8 summarizing the generation (ticks run, content totals, successor subject).
6. **Publish** — via the **publish-session** skill (commit + push to `main`).

## Part B — Spawn the successor

1. **Derive the successor concept** from `lifecycle.policy.succession.rule` applied to the newest
   lineage member (e.g. "the year 2005" → "the year 2006"). If the user passed an explicit subject,
   use that instead.
2. **Create the repository** under the same owner, named by the successor's subject slug (e.g.
   `2006`), public unless the lineage says otherwise. In CI:
   `GH_TOKEN="$LIFECYCLE_PAT" gh repo create <owner>/<slug> --public`.
3. **Plant only the necessary context and files** — nothing else:
   - `.github/` and `.claude/` layers, copied **verbatim** (they are concept-agnostic);
     `.github/workflows/grow.yml` needs the PAT to carry `workflow` scope (classic) /
     Workflows: write (fine-grained) — if the push is rejected for that one file, plant
     everything else, record the omission in the replant log entry, and continue (the shepherd
     fallback in LIFECYCLE.md keeps the successor growing); **never fail the replant over it**;
   - `CLAUDE.md` and `.gitignore`;
   - `lifecycle.yml` — same `policy`, `state.status: growing`, `state.generation_ticks: 0`, the
     **full lineage carried forward** with the new member appended
     (`status: growing`, `spawned_from: <this repo>`);
   - **no** content files, README knowledge table, ROADMAP, or seed inventories — the successor
     grows its own from genesis.
4. **Germinate** — in the successor, run the **genesis** prompt with the successor subject (it
   writes the new seed.md, README, ROADMAP). If genesis cannot be run cross-repo from here, leave a
   bootstrap note: the successor's first scheduled `/grow` must detect the missing seed and run
   `/genesis` itself (the grow workflow handles this).
5. **Close the loop** — fill the successor link into this repo's README *Status* line and
   `lifecycle.yml`, amend/commit/push via **publish-session**.
6. **Register with the driver** — if this repo is not the lineage's first member, also append the
   successor (and this repo's `mature` status) to the **driver repo's** `lifecycle.yml` lineage
   (clone `lineage[0]` via `GH_TOKEN="$LIFECYCLE_PAT"`, edit, push
   `chore: reconcile lineage registry`). The driver's lineage is the registry its workflow's phase
   resolver reads — a stale registry delays distill/consolidate triggers.

## Output Format

```
## Replant Summary

**Generation closed**: <subject> — <N> ticks, <rows> table rows, <files> topic files
**Status**: mature (pushed <SHA>)
**Successor**: <owner>/<slug> — <subject> (created | bootstrap pending /genesis)
**Lineage**: <m> of <consolidate_at_members> members toward consolidation
```
