description: "Run one autonomous growth tick of this knowledge base: plan → generate content and structure → verify → sync the DNA → publish to main. Use when: progressively expanding the repo unattended; running on a schedule (Claude routine) or under /loop; a single hands-off update sweep. Concept-agnostic — reads the concept from seed.md. Delegates to the Architect agent."
argument-hint: "Optional: how many items to do this tick (default 1–3), or specific categories/items to target."

Run **one growth tick** by following the Architect's pipeline. Read the **Concept Definition** in
[seed.md](../../seed.md) first — everything is parameterized by it.

Delegate the full tick to the **Architect** agent
([architect.agent.md](../agents/architect.agent.md)), which executes:

0. **Lifecycle gate** — the **check-lifecycle** skill reads [lifecycle.yml](../../lifecycle.yml);
   phase `replant`/`consolidate` hands off to that prompt instead of ticking; `dormant` stops.
1. **Orient** — read [seed.md](../../seed.md), [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md),
   [README.md](../../README.md), and the repo tree.
2. **Plan** — `plan-roadmap` skill selects the next 1–3 items (honor any argument override).
3. **Execute** — `content` → **Curator** agent; `structure` → **build-structure** skill;
   `meta` → **evolve** prompt (periodic).
4. **Verify** — enforce `concept.scope` + `concept.source_strategy`; no duplicate rows; valid links;
   required frontmatter.
5. **Record** — update [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md); run **sync-seed** (regenerate seed sections
   1–7); run **encode-seed** (append to the Evolution Log); re-run **check-lifecycle** to reconcile
   the generation tick counter.
6. **Publish** — **publish-session** skill commits and pushes to `main`.

End with the Architect's Tick Summary (items done, structure regenerated, roadmap delta, commit SHA).

> Unattended use: register this prompt as a recurring Claude routine via `/schedule` (e.g. daily),
> or run it under `/loop`. Auto-push to `main` requires the run environment to have git push access.
