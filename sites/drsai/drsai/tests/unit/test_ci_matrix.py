"""Tests for the CI matrix cost/coverage contract in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

drsai is a PRIVATE repo, so Actions minutes are billed with per-OS multipliers
(Linux x1, Windows x2, macOS x10). A static 3x3 test matrix billed 39
Linux-equivalent multiplier units on every pull request for a package with no
compiled component. The matrix is therefore trigger-dependent: Linux-only on
pull requests, the full 3x3 on push-to-main, `v*` tags, and the weekly
schedule.

These tests pin BOTH halves of that trade: the cost reduction, and the
guarantees that make it safe to take — the release gate still needs the full
matrix, no supported Python is dropped, and `fail-fast: false` survives.
