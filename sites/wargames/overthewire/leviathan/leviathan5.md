## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `leviathan5`, find the password for `leviathan6`.

### What this level teaches

How symbolic links ("symlinks") can trick a privileged program that trusts a predictable path.

### Key ideas

- **Symlinks.** A symlink is a small file that points at another path; `ln -s TARGET LINKNAME` creates one.
- **Following links.** When a privileged program opens a file, the operating system follows a symlink transparently, using the program's privileges, not yours.
- **Predictable paths.** Programs that use fixed names in shared directories like `/tmp` are open to this.
- **Trace to learn.** `ltrace` reveals the path the program opens.

### How to approach it

1. Run the program and under `ltrace` to find which file it tries to open.
2. Think about what that name could point at instead.

### Why it matters

Insecure use of temporary files is a classic source of local privilege escalation, which is why `mktemp` and unpredictable names exist.
