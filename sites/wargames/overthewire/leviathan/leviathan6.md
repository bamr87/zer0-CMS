## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `leviathan6`, find the password for `leviathan7`.

### What this level teaches

Automating a guessing attack on a small search space.

### Key ideas

- **Search space.** A four-digit code has only 10,000 possibilities.
- **Loops.** A `for` loop with `seq` and `printf` can generate every candidate, including leading zeros.
- **Detecting success.** The program behaves differently on a wrong and a right code, so your loop can stop when the output changes.

### How to approach it

1. Run the program once by hand to learn its arguments and failure behaviour.
2. Write a loop that tries each value and prints only the interesting result.

### Why it matters

It shows why short numeric codes need rate limiting, and gives you practice with shell automation for later games.
