## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `narnia2`, find the password for `narnia3`.

### What this level teaches

The textbook "smash the stack" attack.

### Key ideas

- **Stack frame.** Each function call stores its locals, a saved frame pointer and a return address.
- **Control flow hijack.** Overwriting the return address makes the function return to a place you choose instead of its caller.
- **Finding the offset.** A cyclic pattern in `gdb` or `pwntools` shows exactly how many bytes are needed to reach the return address.
- **Where to jump.** Into your own shellcode, whose address you must find reliably.
- **Reading material.** "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" is the classic paper.

### How to approach it

1. Read the source and note the buffer size and the unsafe copy.
2. In `gdb`, crash the program with a pattern to find the offset.
3. Place shellcode where you can predict its address and aim the return address at it.

### Why it matters

Understanding this attack explains stack canaries, non-executable stacks and address randomisation, all of which exist to stop it.
