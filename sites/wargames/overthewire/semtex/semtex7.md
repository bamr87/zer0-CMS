Multi-vitamin
-------------
Getting out of the restricted shell shouldn't take you more than
five minutes. Then have a look at /rdx/multivitamin. Try to analyse
the algorithm very carefully. There is a weakness that really speeds
up your quest...\

**Multiplication is easy, and so is division...?** You might want to look at [http://gmplib.org/][] if you use c.

## Study guide

**Level map:** analyse the program in `/rdx/multivitamin` after leaving the restricted shell.

### What this level teaches

Restricted-shell escapes and cryptanalysis of an arithmetic scheme.

### Key ideas

- **Restricted shells.** The page says getting out should take about five minutes. Many programs offer ways to run other commands.
- **Study the algorithm carefully.** The page says a weakness really speeds up the solution.
- **Big numbers.** The hint "multiplication is easy and so is division...?" and the link to the GMP library suggest arithmetic on very large numbers.

### How to approach it

1. Get out of the restricted environment.
2. Read the algorithm and identify which operation is easy to reverse.
3. Use a big-number library to implement the attack.

### Why it matters

Number-theoretic schemes are only as strong as the hardness of the underlying problem, and misuse can destroy that hardness.
