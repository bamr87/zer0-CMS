Number-Lock Action
------------------
You are almost on Semtex 3, there is just one big door before you. It is locked with a number lock. **Analyze** and use the locks in /semtex/semtex3 to adjust all the numbers in the correct way. They will open your way to the next level.

Tip : **If you are not good at math, you should consider brute force. Rewrite the program and try all possible combinations of the locks. It wont take more than a few seconds ;)**

## Study guide

**Level map:** the "door" in `/semtex/semtex3` must be unlocked to proceed.

### What this level teaches

Combinatorial analysis, and when brute force beats cleverness.

### Key ideas

- **Analyse the locks.** Work out what each lock does to the numbers.
- **The tip.** If maths is not your strength, rewrite the program and try every combination, which the page says takes only seconds.
- **Search space.** Estimate the number of combinations before you start.

### How to approach it

1. Read the program and write down the rules.
2. Estimate how many combinations there are.
3. Decide between solving it analytically and a simple search.

### Why it matters

Knowing when exhaustive search is cheap is a core security instinct.
