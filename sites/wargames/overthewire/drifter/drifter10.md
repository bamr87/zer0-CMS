If you're not a pro at this stuff yet, here's some additional practice. Beware of the nonexec stack. Go go power reverser.

<!-- study-guide:start -->

## Study guide

**Where it fits:** Drifter level 10 of 0–15, in the privileges and practice stage of the game. The page does not say which account you start as, so check with `id` after connecting.

### What this level teaches

Exploiting a program when the stack is non-executable.

### Key ideas

- **NX stack.** Injected shellcode on the stack will not run.
- **Reuse existing code.** Return-to-libc or ROP chains replace shellcode.
- **Power reversing.** The page urges you to reverse the program thoroughly to find what you can reuse.

### How to approach it

1. Confirm the stack protection and locate the vulnerability.
2. Identify useful functions and gadgets.
3. Build and test the chain in `gdb`.

### Why it matters

Practice with non-executable memory is practice with the modern default.
