Explosive decompression :-)

<!-- study-guide:start -->

## Study guide

**Where it fits:** Drifter level 15 of 0–15, in the open-ended stage of the game. The page does not say which account you start as, so check with `id` after connecting.

### What this level teaches

The dangers of decompression code and of untrusted compressed data.

### Key ideas

- **The only hint.** The level is titled "Explosive decompression".
- **Why decompressors are risky.** They turn small inputs into large outputs, and bugs in size calculations can lead to overflows or resource exhaustion.
- **Careful analysis.** Identify the format, how output size is computed and what is trusted.

### How to approach it

1. Identify what is being decompressed and with what code.
2. Study the size and bounds handling.
3. Craft input that breaks an assumption.

### Why it matters

Decompression bugs have affected image libraries, archive tools and network protocols.
