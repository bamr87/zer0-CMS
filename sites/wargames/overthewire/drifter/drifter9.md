Get ready to escalate those privileges. You'll have to work out a secret file format and attack some security oversights.

<!-- study-guide:start -->

## Study guide

**Where it fits:** Drifter level 9 of 0–15, in the privileges and practice stage of the game. The page does not say which account you start as, so check with `id` after connecting.

### What this level teaches

Local privilege escalation by combining format knowledge and configuration mistakes.

### Key ideas

- **Reverse the format.** The program uses a file format that is not documented; you derive it from the code and examples.
- **Security oversights.** The weakness is not a single memory bug but mistakes in how the program trusts files and permissions.
- **Enumerate.** Look at permissions, ownership and what the program reads and writes.

### How to approach it

1. Trace the program to see which files it opens.
2. Work out the format from the parsing code.
3. Build a file that makes the program do something it should not.

### Why it matters

Most real privilege escalations come from trust mistakes rather than exotic bugs.
