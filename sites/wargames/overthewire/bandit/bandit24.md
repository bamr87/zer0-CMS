Level Goal
----------
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around...

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
chmod, cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use "man 5 crontab" to access this)

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit23`, find the password for `bandit24`.

### What this level teaches

Writing a script, and the danger of a privileged job that executes files other users can write.

### Key ideas

- **Shebang.** The first line `#!/bin/bash` tells the system which interpreter runs the file.
- **Executable bit.** `chmod +x` makes the script runnable; the cron user must also be able to read and run it.
- **Drop directories.** Some jobs run every file placed in a directory, then delete it. Whoever can write to that directory can run code as the job's user.
- **Permissions on your workspace.** The job runs as a different user, so the place where it writes output must allow that.

### How to approach it

1. Read the cron entry and its script and identify which directory it executes and who runs it.
2. Write a tiny script that copies the target password somewhere you can read it, test it by hand, and keep a spare copy because the job deletes the original.
3. Wait for the next scheduled run (check the schedule), then collect the result.

### Why it matters

This is a textbook privilege-escalation pattern: a root-run cron or service that executes files from a world-writable location.
