Level Goal

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit14`, find the password for `bandit15`.

### What this level teaches

What a network service is, and how to talk to one directly.

### Key ideas

- **Client and server.** A server listens on a port; a client connects and exchanges data. Here you are the client.
- **`localhost`** (`127.0.0.1`) means "this very machine", which makes it ideal for safe practice.
- **TCP.** A reliable byte stream. Many simple protocols are just lines of text.
- **`nc` (netcat)** opens a TCP connection and connects it to your keyboard and screen, so you can type to a service like a human protocol client.

### How to approach it

1. Connect to the port the Level Goal gives.
2. Send the previous level's password followed by a newline, and read the reply.
3. Notice that anyone on the network path could read this exchange because it is unencrypted. The next level fixes that.

### Why it matters

Every protocol you know (HTTP, SMTP, Redis) is text over a port, and netcat is the debugging tool for all of them.
