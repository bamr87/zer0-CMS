Level Goal
----------
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `--spaces in this filename--` located in the home directory

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
[ls](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/ls.1.html) , [cd](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/cd.1posix.html) , [cat](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/cat.1.html) , [file](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/file.1.html) , [du](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/du.1.html) , [find](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/find.1.html)

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit2`, find the password for `bandit3`.

### What this level teaches

How the shell splits a command line into words, and how to keep a filename with spaces together.

### Key ideas

- **Word splitting.** The shell breaks a command at every space, so `cat my file` is read as two arguments, `my` and `file`.
- **Quoting** (single or double quotes) and **backslash escaping** both tell the shell "treat this as one word".
- **Tab completion** has the shell finish a name for you, inserting the correct escapes automatically.

### How to approach it

1. `ls` shows the file. Note how its name appears.
2. Try the three techniques above on a harmless file first, for example one you create yourself in a `mktemp -d` directory.
3. Start typing the name and press Tab. Seeing the escapes the shell inserts is the quickest way to understand them.

### Why it matters

Spaces and special characters in filenames cause the classic scripting bugs. Always quoting variables in scripts (`"$file"`) comes directly from this lesson.
