Level Goal
----------
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
[ls](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/ls.1.html) , [cd](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/cd.1posix.html) , [cat](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/cat.1.html) , [file](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/file.1.html) , [du](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/du.1.html) , [find](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/find.1.html)

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit3`, find the password for `bandit4`.

### What this level teaches

How Unix hides files, and why that is a convention rather than a security feature.

### Key ideas

- **Dotfiles.** Any file or directory whose name starts with `.` is skipped by a plain `ls`. They typically hold per-user configuration such as `.bashrc` or `.ssh/`.
- **`ls -a`** shows "all" entries, including `.` (this directory) and `..` (the parent).
- **Hidden is not secret.** Anyone can list the files; the dot only reduces clutter.

### How to approach it

1. Enter the `inhere` directory. A plain `ls` appears empty, which is the clue.
2. Use the option that includes hidden entries, then print the file that is not `.` or `..`.
3. Combine options such as `-la` to also see permissions and sizes.

### Why it matters

Malware and attackers often hide persistence in dotfiles, and incident responders list them first. You will also meet dotfiles daily when configuring tools.
