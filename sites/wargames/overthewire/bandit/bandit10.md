Level Goal
----------
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several '=' characters.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit9`, find the password for `bandit10`.

### What this level teaches

Finding human-readable fragments inside data that is mostly binary.

### Key ideas

- **`strings`** scans a file and prints runs of printable characters. It is a first-look tool for reverse engineers and malware analysts.
- **Binary vs text.** Most of the file is non-printable bytes; the interesting part is a handful of text fragments.
- **Combining tools.** `strings` produces many lines, and `grep` narrows them to those matching the clue (several `=` characters).

### How to approach it

1. Try `cat` on the file and note how unhelpful it is (use `reset` afterwards if your terminal is garbled).
2. Pipe `strings` into `grep` using the pattern described in the Level Goal.

### Why it matters

`strings` is often the very first command run on an unknown executable. You will use it again in Leviathan and other binary games.
