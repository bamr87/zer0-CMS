Level Goal
----------
The password for the next level is stored **somewhere on the server** and has all of the following properties:
-   owned by user bandit7
-   owned by group bandit6
-   33 bytes in size

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
[ls](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/ls.1.html) , [cd](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/cd.1posix.html) , [cat](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/cat.1.html) , [file](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/file.1.html) , [du](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/du.1.html) , [find](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/find.1.html) , [grep](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/grep.1.html)

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit6`, find the password for `bandit7`.

### What this level teaches

Using `find` on the entire filesystem with ownership filters, and handling the flood of "Permission denied" messages that results.

### Key ideas

- **Ownership.** Every file has an owning user and group; `find` can filter on both with `-user` and `-group`.
- **Standard streams.** Programs write results to stdout (file descriptor 1) and errors to stderr (2). Redirecting stderr with `2>/dev/null` discards the noise without hiding results.
- **`/dev/null`** is a special file that swallows everything written to it.
- **Search scope.** Starting from `/` means every directory you cannot read produces an error.

### How to approach it

1. Combine ownership and size tests, starting your search at `/`.
2. Redirect only stderr, so genuine results stay visible.
3. Read the single remaining match.

### Why it matters

Tracking down files by owner is how administrators audit permissions, and redirection is the basis of every shell pipeline you will write.
