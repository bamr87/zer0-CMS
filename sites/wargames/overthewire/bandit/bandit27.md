## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit26`, find the password for `bandit27`.

### What this level teaches

Recognising a pattern you have met before: the setuid binary from Level 20 again, this time as your route to the next user.

### Key ideas

- **Reuse patterns.** After a hard level, the follow-up can be easy, provided you recognise what you are looking at.
- **`ls -l`** shows an `s` in the permissions of a setuid file and who owns it.
- **How the helper behaves.** Run it with no arguments to see what it expects.

### How to approach it

1. List your home directory and spot the setuid program.
2. Work out, from its usage message, how to make it act as `bandit27` on your behalf.
3. Use it to read the file in `/etc/bandit_pass`.

### Why it matters

Mature administrators know "how do I run one command as another user" by heart: `sudo`, setuid helpers and `su` all follow the same idea.
