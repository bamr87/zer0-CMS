Level Goal
----------
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port 2220. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the [Level 1][] page to find out how to beat Level 1.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
[ssh](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man1/ssh.1.html)

## Study guide

**Level map:** this is the starting line. You log in as `bandit0` (password `bandit0`); logging in successfully is the whole level.

### What this level teaches

How to open a secure remote shell. Almost everything in OverTheWire, and most real-world server administration, starts with SSH (Secure Shell): a client on your machine opens an encrypted connection to an SSH server and gives you a command line on the remote computer.

### Key ideas

- **Host** — the machine you connect to, here `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`.
- **Port** — a numbered door on that machine. SSH normally listens on 22, but this server uses 2220, so you must pass the port explicitly. Every OverTheWire game has its own port.
- **Credentials** — a username and password prove who you are. The terminal deliberately shows nothing while you type a password; that is normal, not a frozen screen.
- **Host key fingerprint** — the first time you connect, SSH asks whether to trust the server and remembers its fingerprint in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. If the fingerprint ever changes, SSH warns you that someone may be impersonating the server.

### How to approach it

1. Open a terminal. macOS and Linux include `ssh`; recent Windows versions include it in Command Prompt and PowerShell, and PuTTY is a graphical alternative.
2. The command has the shape `ssh USER@HOST -p PORT`. Fill the three values in from the Level Goal and read the `-p` option in `man ssh` if you are unsure.
3. After logging in, run `whoami` and `pwd` to confirm who and where you are, then `exit` to disconnect. You will repeat this login dance for every level.

### Why it matters

SSH is how engineers administer servers, deploy code and tunnel traffic. Understanding hosts, ports and host-key verification is the foundation for everything that follows.
