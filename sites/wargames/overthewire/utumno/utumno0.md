There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `utumno0`, find the password for `utumno1`.

### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. Utumno is a regular binary-exploitation wargame rescued from intruded.net. Its authors call it slightly harder than Behemoth and a lot harder than Leviathan.

### Where it fits

Utumno is rated 4/10 by its original authors, and lives under `/utumno/` on the game server (SSH port 2227). This is page 1 of 9 in this mirror. Treat the first level as orientation: learn the account layout, the data directory and the tools available before looking for a bug.

### How to approach it

1. Start with `file` and `strings` on the level's program to learn what it is and what text it contains.
2. Check permissions with `ls -l`: a setuid or setgid bit tells you whose privileges the program runs with.
3. If you get stuck repeatedly, finish Behemoth first; the authors explicitly recommend it.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.
