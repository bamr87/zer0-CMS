### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. Utumno is a regular binary-exploitation wargame rescued from intruded.net. Its authors call it slightly harder than Behemoth and a lot harder than Leviathan.

### Where it fits

Utumno is rated 4/10 by its original authors, and lives under `/utumno/` on the game server (SSH port 2227). This is page 2 of 9 in this mirror. Early levels in wargames like this often hinge on a single idea. State your hypothesis in one sentence before you write any exploit.

### How to approach it

1. Run `ltrace` and `strace` to see the library and system calls it makes; they often reveal what it compares, opens or executes.
2. Note the architecture and which protections are active (`file`, `readelf -l`), so you know which techniques are possible.
3. If you get stuck repeatedly, finish Behemoth first; the authors explicitly recommend it.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.
