## Study guide

This guide explains what Abraxas is and how to run it safely. It does not describe the challenges, which are meant to be discovered.

### What it is

Abraxas was introduced at the Hackito Ergo Sum (HES) conference in Paris in 2011. It is centred on a fictitious company, and the game has its own website containing the whole backstory. Since September 2011 it has been released to the public and can be downloaded as an `.ova` virtual-machine image from the OverTheWire image server.

### How it differs from the SSH games

Games such as Bandit and Narnia run on OverTheWire servers. Abraxas runs on your own computer: you import the virtual machine and play entirely offline. Instructions for the game are included on the disk image itself, which is why the upstream page ends with a heading and nothing below it.

### Getting started

1. Download the OVA file from the link on the page (it is a large file; verify the download completes).
2. Import it into VirtualBox or another hypervisor that supports OVA.
3. Read the instructions on the image and the backstory website, then start investigating.

### Run it safely

- **Isolate the network.** These images are intentionally vulnerable. Use a host-only or internal network in your hypervisor so the machine is not reachable from the internet or your home network.
- **Snapshot before you start.** A snapshot lets you roll back after you break something.
- **Use a disposable environment.** A spare virtual machine host, not the laptop that holds your real data.
- **Change default credentials** if you ever connect a lab image to a shared network.
- **Keep notes.** Story-driven games reward writing down every credential, host and clue as you find it.

### Where this fits

Conference wargames suit people who have already completed several of the main games, such as Bandit, Natas and Narnia, and want story-driven, multi-step challenges.
