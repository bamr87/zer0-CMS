There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `maze9`. This is the highest-numbered Maze page in this mirror (`maze9`).

### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. Maze is a harder binary-exploitation wargame. Its authors say it needs knowledge of exploitation techniques, programming and reverse engineering, and that the levels are deliberately tricky and sometimes strange.

### Where it fits

Maze is rated 5/10 by its original authors, and lives under `/maze/` on the game server (SSH port 2225). This is page 10 of 10 in this mirror. Final levels reward patience: break the problem into steps and test each one before chaining them.

### How to approach it

1. Run `ltrace` and `strace` to see the library and system calls it makes; they often reveal what it compares, opens or executes.
2. Note the architecture and which protections are active (`file`, `readelf -l`), so you know which techniques are possible.
3. The authors' advice is to get ready to use `gdb`; step through the program rather than guessing.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.

### What to do next

- **Consolidate.** For each level, record the bug class, the tool that found it and the technique that worked.
- **Continue.** From the [games index](../../), Vortex is a natural next step.
- **Read about defences.** Stack canaries, non-executable memory, ASLR and RELRO each map to attacks you have practised.
