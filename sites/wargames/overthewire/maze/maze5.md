There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `maze5`, find the password for `maze6`.

### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. Maze is a harder binary-exploitation wargame. Its authors say it needs knowledge of exploitation techniques, programming and reverse engineering, and that the levels are deliberately tricky and sometimes strange.

### Where it fits

Maze is rated 5/10 by its original authors, and lives under `/maze/` on the game server (SSH port 2225). This is page 6 of 10 in this mirror. Mid-game levels in wargames like this often add constraints that break the textbook technique, such as filtered bytes or a cleared environment, so be ready to adapt.

### How to approach it

1. Try unusual input: nothing, far too much, special characters, and unexpected arguments or environment variables.
2. Start with `file` and `strings` on the level's program to learn what it is and what text it contains.
3. The authors' advice is to get ready to use `gdb`; step through the program rather than guessing.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.
