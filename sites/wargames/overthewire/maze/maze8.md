## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `maze8`, find the password for `maze9`.

### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. Maze is a harder binary-exploitation wargame. Its authors say it needs knowledge of exploitation techniques, programming and reverse engineering, and that the levels are deliberately tricky and sometimes strange.

### Where it fits

Maze is rated 5/10 by its original authors, and lives under `/maze/` on the game server (SSH port 2225). This is page 9 of 10 in this mirror. Later levels tend to combine ideas from earlier ones, so reread your notes on previous levels for tools you can reuse.

### How to approach it

1. Start with `file` and `strings` on the level's program to learn what it is and what text it contains.
2. Check permissions with `ls -l`: a setuid or setgid bit tells you whose privileges the program runs with.
3. The authors' advice is to get ready to use `gdb`; step through the program rather than guessing.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.
