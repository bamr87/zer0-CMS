There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## Study guide

<div class="sg-map" markdown="1">
**Level map:** the account for this page is `formulaone3`; the index tells you levels are accounts named `formulaone0`, `formulaone1` and so on.
</div>

### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. FormulaOne is another wargame rescued from intruded.net. Its index gives very little away beyond where to connect.

### Where it fits

FormulaOne is not given a difficulty rating in its index, and lives under `/formulaone/` on the game server (SSH port 2232). This is page 4 of 7 in this mirror. Mid-game levels in wargames like this often add constraints that break the textbook technique, such as filtered bytes or a cleared environment, so be ready to adapt.

### How to approach it

1. Check permissions with `ls -l`: a setuid or setgid bit tells you whose privileges the program runs with.
2. Open the program in `gdb`, break at `main`, and step through to see exactly how your input is used.
3. The index says the source code for the first level can be read by logging in to a different wargame hosted on the same server, and that figuring out which one is your first task.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.
