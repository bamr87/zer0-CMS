## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas31` and find the password for `natas32`.

### What this level teaches

How a language feature meant for convenience becomes a file read vulnerability when input is user-controlled.

### Key ideas

- **The diamond operator.** In Perl, `<>` reads from files named on the command line or from standard input, and its handling of special names is surprising.
- **CGI file uploads.** An upload parameter can be either a file or a plain string depending on how the request is built.
- **Dual nature of a value.** The script treats a value as a file handle in one place and as a name in another.
- **Read the documentation.** Perl's `perlop` description of `<>` and `<<>>` explains the behaviour.

### How to approach it

1. Study how the script reads the uploaded file.
2. Work out how to make the same parameter mean something different to the second use.

### How developers prevent it

Use the safe double-diamond form, avoid reading from user-supplied names, and test upload handling with unexpected input shapes.
