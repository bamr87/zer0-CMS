## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas33` and find the password for `natas34`.

### What this level teaches

How seemingly harmless file functions can trigger object deserialisation.

### Key ideas

- **Phar archives.** PHP can read an archive format called phar, which stores serialised metadata.
- **Stream wrappers.** File functions accept URL-like paths such as `phar://...`; opening one can cause the metadata to be unserialised automatically.
- **Gadget in the source.** A class in the page code performs an unsafe action when it is destroyed.
- **Building a phar.** PHP's `Phar` class lets you create one with your own metadata, if the build is allowed in your environment.

### How to approach it

1. Read the upload and checking code carefully, and find the class that does something interesting.
2. Work out how to get your file to the server and make a file function open it as a phar.

### How developers prevent it

Disallow `phar://` for user-controlled paths, update PHP, and avoid dangerous classes that act on destruction.
