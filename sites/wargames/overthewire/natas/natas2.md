## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas2` and find the password for `natas3`.

### What this level teaches

How to enumerate the resources a page loads and explore the directories they live in.

### Key ideas

- **A page references other files.** Images, scripts and stylesheets each have a URL, and those URLs reveal folder names.
- **Directory listing.** If a web server has "autoindex" enabled and a directory has no index page, visiting it lists every file inside.
- **Walking up the path.** Removing the last part of a URL moves you to the parent folder, a basic reconnaissance move.

### How to approach it

1. Read the source and list every resource the page references.
2. Visit the folder that holds a resource and see what the server shows you.

### How developers prevent it

Disable directory listings, keep sensitive files out of the web root, and treat every file reachable by URL as public.
