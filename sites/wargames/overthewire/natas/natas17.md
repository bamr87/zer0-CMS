## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas17` and find the password for `natas18`.

### What this level teaches

Using response time as the only observable signal.

### Key ideas

- **Time as a channel.** If the page always looks the same, you can still make the database pause when a condition is true and measure how long the response takes.
- **Delay functions.** SQL dialects provide ways to sleep or run an expensive operation conditionally.
- **Noise.** Network jitter produces false positives, so choose a delay that is clearly larger than normal variation and consider repeating questionable guesses.

### How to approach it

1. Use the previous blind level as your template.
2. Replace "true/false in the page" with "slow/fast response".
3. Time each request in your script and choose a threshold carefully.

### How developers prevent it

Use parameterised queries, impose database query time limits, and alert on unusual response times.
