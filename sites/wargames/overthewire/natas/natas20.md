## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas20` and find the password for `natas21`.

### What this level teaches

How custom serialisation formats create injection bugs.

### Key ideas

- **Session storage.** Server-side sessions keep a small file or record of values keyed by the session ID.
- **Line-based format.** The handler writes one `key value` pair per line, so a newline in your input looks like a new entry.
- **Two requests.** The application reads the session at the start of a request, so a poisoned write on one request can take effect on the next.
- **Read the code.** The source for the custom `myread` and `mywrite` handlers is the whole puzzle.

### How to approach it

1. Read how a value you supply ends up inside the stored session.
2. Think about what a line break lets you add.
3. Make the first request to write the data, and the second to benefit from it.

### How developers prevent it

Use your framework's well-tested session handlers, and encode data (for example JSON) instead of inventing a format that can be broken by delimiters.
