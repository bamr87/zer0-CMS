## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas18` and find the password for `natas19`.

### What this level teaches

Why session identifiers must be large, random and unpredictable.

### Key ideas

- **Sessions.** After login the server gives you an identifier in a cookie, and that identifier alone proves who you are.
- **Small space.** If IDs are just small numbers, an attacker can try them all and eventually find an authenticated admin.
- **Scripting.** Loop over the possible values, set the cookie and look for a change in the response.

### How to approach it

1. Read the source and work out the range of session IDs the application can issue.
2. Write a loop that sends each candidate in the session cookie.
3. Detect success by a distinctive difference in the reply.

### How developers prevent it

Use long cryptographically random session IDs from your framework, rotate them at login, expire them and bind them to additional checks where appropriate.
