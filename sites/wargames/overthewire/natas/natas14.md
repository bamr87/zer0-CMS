## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas14` and find the password for `natas15`.

### What this level teaches

SQL injection: input that changes the meaning of a database query.

### Key ideas

- **String concatenation is the flaw.** The code inserts the username and password directly into a query string, so quotes in your input can end the string and add logic.
- **Boolean logic.** A condition such as `1=1` is always true, so a `WHERE` clause containing `OR` of it matches every row.
- **Comments.** SQL comment markers can discard the remainder of a query.
- **Read the source.** The page provides it; the exact query shape tells you what to inject.

### How to approach it

1. Read the query the code builds and imagine the final text for ordinary input.
2. Work out how to complete or break out of the quoted strings to make the check always succeed.

### How developers prevent it

Use parameterised queries (prepared statements) so input is always data, never SQL.
