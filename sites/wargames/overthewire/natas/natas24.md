## Study guide

**Level map:** sign in as `natas24` and find the password for `natas25`.

### What this level teaches

How unexpected input types can defeat a security comparison.

### Key ideas

- **Parameters can be arrays.** In PHP, a form field written like `name[]` arrives as an array, not a string.
- **Functions misbehave on the wrong type.** Passing an array where a string is expected produces a warning and a surprising return value.
- **Loose comparison of that value.** The check then treats the result as success.
- **Read the manual.** The PHP documentation for `strcmp` lists its return values.

### How to approach it

1. Work out what the code compares and how it interprets the result.
2. Consider what input types you can send that the developer did not imagine.

### How developers prevent it

Validate input types, use strict comparison, and modern PHP versions that raise errors when the wrong type is passed.
