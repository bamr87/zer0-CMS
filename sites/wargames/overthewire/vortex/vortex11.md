Chunk Corruption
----------------
You must corrupt the heap in order to gain arbitrary control of this program. Do recall, the application is using phkmalloc.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex11`, obtain access to `vortex12`.

### What this level teaches

Heap exploitation against a specific allocator.

### Key ideas

- **The heap.** Dynamically allocated memory managed by an allocator that keeps its own metadata.
- **phkmalloc.** The BSD allocator named in the level; its structure determines which corruptions are useful.
- **Chunk corruption.** Overflowing one allocation into a neighbour's metadata can turn later allocator operations into controlled writes.
- **Reading.** The page lists BSD heap smashing, "Once upon a free()", Doug Lea malloc exploits and "Exploiting the Wilderness".

### How to approach it

1. Read the papers and then the allocator's behaviour in this program.
2. Map how allocations are laid out for a given input.
3. Craft the overflow and confirm its effect in a debugger.

### Why it matters

Heap bugs dominate modern vulnerability reports, and the techniques follow the same ideas.
