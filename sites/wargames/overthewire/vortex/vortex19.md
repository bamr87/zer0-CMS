Key Generation
--------------
This level requires you to "keygen" the level, with a minor obstacle of a weak form of binary encryption in place.

<!-- study-guide:start -->

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex19`, obtain access to `vortex20`.

### What this level teaches

Reverse-engineering a licence or key check, and working around obfuscation.

### Key ideas

- **Keygen.** A program that creates valid keys by replicating the check's algorithm.
- **Binary encryption.** The program's code is partly encrypted in a weak way, so you must decode or unpack it before you can read the check.
- **Debug the unpacker.** The decryption routine itself is your way in.

### How to approach it

1. Find how and when the code is decrypted.
2. Dump the decoded version and analyse the check.
3. Reproduce the algorithm in your own program.

### Why it matters

Packers and obfuscators appear in malware and licence schemes, and unpacking is a basic skill.
