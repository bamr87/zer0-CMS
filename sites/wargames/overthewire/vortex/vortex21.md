Reverse Me
----------
This level is a slightly more difficult reverse me (which might require understanding the encryptor for it).

<!-- study-guide:start -->

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex21`, obtain access to `vortex22`.

### What this level teaches

Reverse engineering a program whose logic depends on an encryption routine.

### Key ideas

- **Understand the encryptor.** The page warns you may need to understand how it works.
- **Divide the program.** Separate the input handling, the transformation and the comparison.
- **Invert.** Once you know the transformation, work backwards from the target.

### How to approach it

1. Locate the encryption routine and describe it in pseudocode.
2. Write an equivalent function and test it against the binary's output.
3. Invert it to obtain the required input.

### Why it matters

Understanding custom crypto from binaries is a staple of malware analysis.
