Remote Integer Fun
------------------
The source code for the exploitable application can be found in "/home/vortex20". You must login to [vortex.labs.overthewire.org][] to complete this level.

[vortex.labs.overthewire.org]: ssh://vortex.labs.overthewire.org:2228

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex20`, obtain access to `vortex21`. The exploitable source is in `/home/vortex20`.

### What this level teaches

Integer overflows, sign confusion and length checks that go wrong.

### Key ideas

- **Source provided.** Read it carefully; every arithmetic operation on a length or index deserves scrutiny.
- **Integer pitfalls.** Wrap-around, signed versus unsigned comparison and truncation all turn safe-looking checks into bypassable ones.
- **Remote.** You interact over the network, so scripting and careful framing of data are essential.

### How to approach it

1. List each integer in the code with its type and where it is checked and used.
2. Find a value that passes the check but breaks the later use.
3. Build the network exchange to deliver it.

### Why it matters

Integer errors lead to buffer overflows in many real programs and are easy to overlook in review.
