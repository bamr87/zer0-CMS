The BOFH
--------
This level requires finding 100 bits out of a 128 bit randomly generated hashed key. You must login to [vortex.labs.overthewire.org][] to complete this level.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex16`, obtain access to `vortex17`.

### What this level teaches

The cost and structure of partial hash search.

### Key ideas

- **The task as stated.** The page describes it as finding 100 bits out of a randomly generated, hashed 128-bit key. Read the level's code to see exactly which bits must match and what you control.
- **Cost estimation.** Matching fewer bits is exponentially cheaper than matching all of them: each extra required bit roughly doubles the expected work.
- **Speed.** Efficient C and parallel search make the difference between hours and years.

### How to approach it

1. Read exactly what must match, and how many bits.
2. Estimate expected work for the plan you choose.
3. Implement and benchmark on smaller bit counts first.

### Why it matters

It illustrates truncated hashes and why a short checksum gives only weak assurance.
