We don't want no executable stack
---------------------------------
Exploit this level knowing that the stack is not executable. You must login to [vortex.labs.overthewire.org][] to complete this level..

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex12`, obtain access to `vortex13`.

### What this level teaches

Defeating the non-executable stack.

### Key ideas

- **NX stack.** The CPU refuses to run code placed on the stack, so injected shellcode will not work.
- **Alternatives.** Reuse existing code (return-to-libc) or chain short code fragments (return-oriented programming).
- **Library locations.** Use `ldd` and `gdb` to find functions and strings in loaded libraries.
- **Login required.** The page says you must log in to the Vortex host to complete this level.

### How to approach it

1. Confirm the stack is non-executable and read the vulnerable code.
2. Pick a function in the C library that does what you need, and find the address of a string for its argument.
3. Lay out the stack frame as the function expects.

### Why it matters

Non-executable memory is standard today, so ret2libc and ROP are the baseline techniques.
