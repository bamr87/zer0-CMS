Working Backwards
-----------------
This level requires you to work backwards to find out what's happening then exploit it. You must login to [vortex.labs.overthewire.org][] to complete this level.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex17`, obtain access to `vortex18`.

### What this level teaches

Reasoning from effects back to causes.

### Key ideas

- **Reverse reasoning.** Start from what the program outputs or does and deduce what inputs and internal state produced it.
- **Instrument.** Use tracing and a debugger to see intermediate values.
- **Then attack.** Once you understand the logic, the vulnerability becomes clear.

### How to approach it

1. Gather the observable behaviour in detail.
2. Build a model that explains it.
3. Look for where the model allows a mistake you can exploit.

### Why it matters

Debugging and exploit work are both inference problems.
