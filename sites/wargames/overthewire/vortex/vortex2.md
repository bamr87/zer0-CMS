## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex2`, obtain access to `vortex3`.

### What this level teaches

How an archive format works and how a program that handles archives can be steered.

### Key ideas

- **tar format.** A tar archive is a sequence of header blocks and data; the page links the GNU tar manual.
- **Crafting input.** Instead of using `tar` normally, think about which fields and filenames you control.
- **Find your lever.** The page says only that a special tar file is needed, so work out which part of the program's use of tar you control: names, options or contents.

### How to approach it

1. Read the GNU tar manual sections on formats and options.
2. Look at the level's program under `/vortex/` and trace how it invokes tar.
3. Build and test small archives before the final one.

### Why it matters

Archive handling flaws (path traversal, symlinks, overwrite) are common real vulnerabilities.
