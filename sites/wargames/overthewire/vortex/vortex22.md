Object Analysis
---------------
This is another keygen level. You might want to check "/vortex/vortex22\_\*.o" for some object files.

<!-- study-guide:start -->

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex22`, obtain access to `vortex23`.

### What this level teaches

Using object files to understand a program's pieces.

### Key ideas

- **Object files** (`.o`) contain compiled code and symbols before linking, so they often have more names than the final binary.
- **Where to look.** The page points to files matching `/vortex/vortex22_*.o`.
- **Keygen again.** Replicate the validation, then produce valid input.

### How to approach it

1. Inspect the object files with `objdump -d` and `nm`.
2. Rebuild the logic of the check.
3. Write a generator and test it on the real program.

### Why it matters

Intermediate build artefacts can leak much more than a stripped final binary.
