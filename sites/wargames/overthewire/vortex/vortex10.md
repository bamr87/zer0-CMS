Random?
-------
Read in 20 integers and write the seed used to generate those numbers in unsigned little endian format. You have a time limit of 30 seconds to do this. You must login to [vortex.labs.overthewire.org][]

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex10`, obtain access to `vortex11`.

### What this level teaches

Why pseudo-random number generators are predictable if you know how they work.

### Key ideas

- **PRNG state.** A generator's output is entirely determined by its seed and algorithm.
- **The task.** Read 20 integers and write back the seed that generated them, in unsigned little-endian format, within 30 seconds.
- **Search or invert.** Either search the seed space efficiently or invert the generator's algorithm.
- **Time pressure.** A script is essential; manual work will not meet the limit.

### How to approach it

1. Identify the generator and how it was seeded from the level's behaviour.
2. Write a program that reproduces its output for a candidate seed.
3. Automate the exchange end to end and test timing.

### Why it matters

Predictable seeds have broken real systems, from session tokens to game servers and cryptographic keys.
