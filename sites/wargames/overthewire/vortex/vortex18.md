urandom seeds
-------------
Take advantage of the application's urandom dependency.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex18`, obtain access to `vortex19`.

### What this level teaches

How randomness sources are used, and what happens when a program uses them badly.

### Key ideas

- **`/dev/urandom`.** A cryptographically strong source of random bytes; it is only as good as how the program uses it.
- **Dependence.** The program relies on it in a way you can influence or predict.
- **Environment control.** Think about what the program does if the random source behaves differently, is exhausted, or is read in an unexpected way.

### How to approach it

1. Trace the program's file and system calls with `strace`.
2. See exactly how many bytes it reads and what it does with them.
3. Find the assumption that fails.

### Why it matters

Seeding mistakes are a recurring cause of weak keys and tokens.
