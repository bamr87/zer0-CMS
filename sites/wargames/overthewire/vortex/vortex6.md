Generic Binary Exploitation
---------------------------
You must disassemble this level's exploitable application in order to find the hole.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex6`, obtain access to `vortex7`.

### What this level teaches

Reverse engineering a program to discover a vulnerability without any description.

### Key ideas

- **No hints on purpose.** The page says only that you must disassemble the exploitable application.
- **Reading assembly.** Identify function boundaries, arguments and local buffers, and rebuild what the C source would have looked like.
- **Reading.** The page links two papers on reconstructing binaries to C for beginners and on reading functions in disassembly.

### How to approach it

1. Run the program normally, then disassemble with `objdump -d` or a GUI tool.
2. Annotate each function with what it does, searching for unsafe copies and unchecked lengths.
3. Test your suspicion with oversized input, then build the exploit.

### Why it matters

This is the real-world situation: no source, only a binary.
