Weak Encryption
---------------
You have found an encrypted file, decrypt it (some reversing, crypt and general analysis needed, and if you're lazy, the password is 8-bytes long and contains values between A and Z). You must login to [vortex.labs.overthewire.org][] to complete this level.

## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `vortex15`, obtain access to `vortex16`.

### What this level teaches

Combining reverse engineering with cryptanalysis.

### Key ideas

- **Know the key space.** If the password is 8 bytes between A and Z, there are 26 to the power 8 (about 209 billion) possibilities, large but structured.
- **Find the algorithm.** Reverse the program that encrypted the file to see how the key is used.
- **Exploit structure.** Weak ciphers leak information, so you may recover the key piece by piece rather than guess all of it.

### How to approach it

1. Reverse the encryption routine.
2. Look for weaknesses in how the key is applied.
3. Recover the key and decrypt the file.

### Why it matters

Many proprietary file protections are weak. Knowing how to analyse them shows why standard, reviewed algorithms are essential.
