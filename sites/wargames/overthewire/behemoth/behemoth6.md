## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `behemoth6`, find the password for `behemoth7`.

### What this level teaches

Stepping up from a single technique to a combined challenge.

### Key ideas

- **Read what is provided.** Look in `/behemoth/` for the level's binary and any helper files it uses.
- **Understand the helper.** Trace how the main program invokes it and what data flows between them.
- **Shellcode skills.** You may need to write or adapt small machine-code payloads.
- **Test in pieces.** Verify each stage before running the whole chain.

### How to approach it

1. List the files and permissions, then trace what the program starts.
2. Work out which part you control and how it is interpreted.
3. Build the payload step by step.

### Why it matters

Real attacks are multi-stage, and breaking them into verified steps is the key to getting them working.
