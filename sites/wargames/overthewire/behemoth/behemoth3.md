## Study guide

**Level map:** logged in as `behemoth3`, find the password for `behemoth4`.

### What this level teaches

Format-string exploitation starting from a compiled program.

### Key ideas

- **Recognising the bug.** The program prints your input with a `printf`-style call without a fixed format. Feeding `%x` specifiers shows stack contents.
- **Locating your input** on the stack with positional specifiers.
- **Choosing a target to overwrite.** A function pointer, a Global Offset Table entry or a return address can redirect execution.
- **Where to put shellcode.** An environment variable is a convenient place, and its address can be computed.

### How to approach it

1. Confirm the vulnerability with a harmless sequence of specifiers.
2. Find the stack index of your own input.
3. Decide on the target and the value, then build the write.

### Why it matters

It repeats a technique you learned earlier in a more realistic setting.
