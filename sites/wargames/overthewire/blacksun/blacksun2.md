Level2 is a test application from a [pop3 library][] that's pretty buggy. The idea is to write a pop3 server to trigger a vulnerability (pick any you like :p) in the code and get a shell.

**Notes**

-   -fpic -fPIC was added to the compile options to remote DT\_TEXTREL's
    :p
-   If you're feeling generous, perhaps drop the author a note about any
    bugs you find so that future versions of the library can be fixed.
-   ASLR remote fun!

## Study guide

<div class="sg-map" markdown="1">
**Level map:** the test client is `/levels/level2`, built from the libspopc 0.7 sources in `/levels/2/`.
</div>

### What this level teaches

Attacking a client by controlling the server it talks to.

### Key ideas

- **The server is the attacker.** The test application connects to a POP3 server; you write that server and craft responses that trigger a bug in the parsing code.
- **Code auditing.** The challenge says to pick any vulnerability you like, so finding one comes first. Read the library source for unchecked lengths and copies.
- **Position-independent code.** The note about compile options means libraries use relocatable code, so addresses are randomised.
- **Remote and ASLR.** You must work out addresses without being able to attach a debugger to the live run.
- **Be generous.** The page suggests telling the library's author about any real bugs you find.

### How to approach it

1. Read the POP3 protocol basics and the library's response-handling code.
2. Build a minimal fake server that produces ordinary responses, then alter one field at a time.
3. Turn a crash into control of execution.

### Why it matters

Malicious servers attacking vulnerable clients (mail clients, browsers, update tools) are a major real-world attack class.
