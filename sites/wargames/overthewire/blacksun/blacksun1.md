Level1 is a trivial stack buffer overflow. Note that you'll probably find it easier to use the compiled version than compiling it from source.

### Binary information

| Stack smashing protection (SSP): 	      | Disabled	|
| Postition Independent Executable (PIE):     | Disabled	|
| Address space layout randomisation (ASLR):  | Enabled - No PIE|
| Non-executable pages: 		      | None / disabled	|

## Study guide

**Level map:** the vulnerable program is `/levels/level1` on the Blacksun host.

### What this level teaches

How to reason about which parts of an address space are randomised and which are not.

### Key ideas

- **ASLR without PIE.** The stack and libraries move, but the main program's code and data stay at fixed addresses, so you can still reference them.
- **No stack protector.** There is no canary to detect an overwritten return address.
- **Use the compiled binary.** The page notes that it is easier to analyse the compiled version than to compile the source yourself.
- **Non-executable pages are off,** so classic shellcode is possible, but you must find a reliable way to reach it.

### How to approach it

1. Check the protections with the table on the page and with tools such as `checksec`.
2. Find the offset to the return address in `gdb`.
3. Choose a return target that is stable despite randomisation.

### Why it matters

Understanding what each mitigation does and does not randomise is the heart of exploit development.
