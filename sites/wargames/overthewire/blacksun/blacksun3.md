Level3 is a blast from the past, with not much details and a sstriped binary!

Experiment around / partially disassemble level3, work out what it wants, and how to exploit it. Some bruteforcing may be required ;)

### Binary information

| Stack smashing protection (SSP):            | Enabled         |
| Postition Independent Executable (PIE):     | Disabled        |
| Address space layout randomisation (ASLR):  | Enabled 	|
| Non-executable pages:                       | None / disabled |

## Study guide

**Level map:** the target is `/levels/level3`; it is a stripped binary with stack protection and ASLR on and PIE off.

### What this level teaches

Reverse engineering with no symbols and no source.

### Key ideas

- **Stripped binaries.** Function names are gone, so you identify functions by behaviour and by the library calls they make.
- **Partial disassembly.** The page encourages experimenting and disassembling only the interesting parts.
- **Stack protector.** With SSP enabled, overwriting the return address crudely will abort the program, so you need a way around or an information leak.
- **Brute force.** If a protection value has few possibilities per attempt, repeated attempts can defeat it.

### How to approach it

1. Run the program, observe its behaviour and input format, and trace its system calls.
2. Disassemble the input-handling path in `objdump` or Ghidra.
3. Identify the weakness and decide whether a leak or brute force is the practical bypass.

### Why it matters

Most real targets have no source. Learning to find the bug from the binary is a core skill.
